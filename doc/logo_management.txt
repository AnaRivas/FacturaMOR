FACTURAgem: Logo Management
---------------------------

In FACTURAgem each account may have a logo. If an account has a logo, it is
inserted in invoices.

We do not maintain a history of customers data, if for example they change
their address no versioning of the customers table is performed, but we do
store everything in invoices as they were created/edited, to be able to
reproduce them at any point in the future.

This rationale applies to logos, but they are not the same as strings, so a
few important considerations are needed:

  1. we need the logo as a file for pdflatex

  2. logos are images, we should be careful about the space they need

Since logos are images and we need them for pdflatex as files we will store them as files.

Since we do not have a history of logos per account, and each new invoice can
only use the current logo, we will store one logo per customer, and create
hard links to it per new invoice. This way, if an account has uploaded two
logos since it uses the application, whose size adds say 150K, even if it has
hundreds of invoices the logos will be kept at 150K and at the same time they
all invoices will be reproducible as they were created.

Additionally, different environments need different disk locations, so we end
with this layout

  RAILS_ROOT/logos/<environment>/accounts
  RAILS_ROOT/logos/<environment>/invoices

By now we won't create subdirectories, if there are too much files we will
modify this layout to create some partitions.
